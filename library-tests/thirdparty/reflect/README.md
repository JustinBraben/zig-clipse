## Overview

This is meant as an educational project to get some experience with Zig's metaprogramming capabilities. The Zig Reflection Library is a versatile toolkit for enabling reflection and generic programming in Zig. It aims to provide developers with powerful features to enhance flexibility and dynamism within their Zig projects. 

## Features

1. **Type Information Retrieval:**
   - Retrieve size, alignment, and name of types.
   - Access information about fields and methods.

2. **Instance Reflection:**
   - Inspect and manipulate fields and methods of a specific instance.

3. **Generic Programming Support:**
   - Work with generic types and functions.
   - Extract information about type parameters.

4. **Function and Callable Object Reflection:**
   - Obtain details about functions and callable objects.
   - Invoke functions dynamically.

5. **Enum Reflection:**
   - Retrieve information about enum variants.
   - Enumerate through enum variants.

6. **Annotations and Metadata:**
   - Attach and query metadata or annotations on types, fields, functions, etc.

7. **Serialization and Deserialization:**
   - Generate serialization and deserialization code for types.
   - Support various serialization formats (JSON, XML, etc.).

8. **Object Initialization and Construction:**
   - Dynamically create instances of types.
   - Call init with dynamic arguments.

9. **Dynamic Dispatch:**
   - Enable dynamic method dispatch for interfaces or trait-like structures.

10. **Introspection for Zig Documentation:**
    - Assist in generating documentation by providing information about types, functions, and relationships.

11. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
    - Ensure seamless operation across different platforms supported by Zig.

12. **Performance Considerations:**
    - Optimize for efficiency to align with Zig's principles.

13. **Integration with Zig Build System:**
    - Explore easy integration into Zig's build system for developer convenience.

14. **Unit Testing Support:**
    - Facilitate unit testing and debugging with runtime variable inspection.
